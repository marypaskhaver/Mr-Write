# Mr-Write

This is the second app I made in Swift, and aims to help aspiring writers (like me!). It is capable of generating thousands of names by gender and/or genre, settings and atmospheres, and all kinds of writing prompts. It can also intake a user's name and convert it to a different kind: think of what your pirate or fantasy name would be. 

While making this app, I learned about how to read from text files in Swift and how to manipulate Strings using Swift's random function. I also learned how to create a dictionary with functions whose keys corresponded to input from a pickerView, and to have objects communicate between classes to display the appropriate output. Lastly, I studied more principles of Object-Oriented Programming, learning to split up my classes and methods more.  

If I were to develop this app further, I would include more items for the user to generate. However, I would also like to create a Settings tab where the user could select the genres or types of prompts they wanted to see and thus limit or increase the number of choices in the user's pickerView.
