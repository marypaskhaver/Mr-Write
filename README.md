# Mr-Write

This is the second app I made in Swift, and aims to help aspiring writers (like me!). It is capable of generating thousands of names by gender and/or genre, settings and atmospheres, and all kinds of writing prompts. It can also intake a user's name and convert it to a different kind: think of what your pirate or fantasy name would be. 

While making this app, I learned about how to read from text files in Swift, as well as how to use a pickerView to call functions stored inside dictionaries. I also studied more principles of Object-Oriented Programming, learning to split up my classes and methods more.
